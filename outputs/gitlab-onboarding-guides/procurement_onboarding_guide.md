## Introduction to the GitLab Procurement Team

### Mission and Vision

The Procurement Team at GitLab manages the entire supplier lifecycle, from vendor vetting and selection to contract negotiation, purchasing, renewals, and offboarding. The team supports all GitLab divisions with spend over $25,000 USD annually, ensuring procurement aligns with business needs, cost efficiency, and risk mitigation.

**Key Objectives:**

- Build strategic partnerships with internal stakeholders.  
- Drive cost savings through negotiation and spend management.  
- Manage and mitigate third-party risks.  
- Promote responsible sourcing and supplier diversity.  
- Maintain structured, repeatable supplier management processes, including RFPs and market reviews every three years.

### Team Structure and Roles

The team is organized primarily by spend level and procurement category:

- **Spend > $25,000 USD per year:** Managed by division-aligned Procurement Category Managers (e.g., Marketing & Sales, Product, Engineering).  
- **Spend < $25,000 USD:** Managed by a dedicated team member for smaller purchases.  
- **Individual Software Purchases:** Managed separately to streamline approvals.

Understanding this structure helps you know who to collaborate with and clarifies your scope of responsibility.

### Remote-First Culture

GitLab operates fully remotely with asynchronous communication as the norm. The Procurement Team leverages tools like Slack, GitLab Issues, Zip, and Coupa to maintain transparency and efficiency across time zones. Embracing this culture means developing strong written communication skills, self-service learning habits, and proactive collaboration.

## Core Procurement Workflow and Lifecycle

### Step 1: Initiating a Purchase Request

- All purchase requests begin in **Zip**, GitLab’s internal procurement request system accessed via Okta.  
- Requesters submit detailed requests, attaching supporting documents such as contracts or quotes.  
- Zip supports various request types: new spend under $25,000, renewals, change requests, $0 contract reviews, partner revenue payments, individual software purchases, and termination notices.

### Step 2: Approval Workflow

- Requests route through multi-level approvals involving FP&A, management, Security, Privacy, and Legal as needed.  
- Approval timelines vary from 5 days to over 3 weeks depending on complexity and vendor status.  
- Urgent requests (<5 business days) require clear business impact justification and escalation via Slack.

### Step 3: Purchase Order Generation and Order Placement

- Upon approval, **Coupa** generates the official Purchase Order (PO).  
- Suppliers receive the PO and payment instructions, submitting invoices referencing the PO number.  
- For some purchases, virtual one-time use credit cards are issued; receipts must be forwarded to Accounts Payable.

### Step 4: Invoice Submission and Review

- Vendors submit invoices via Coupa Supplier Portal or email (ap@gitlab.com).  
- Requesters review invoices for accuracy before approval.  
- All invoices and receipts are sent to Accounts Payable for payment processing.

### Step 5: Payment Processing

- Payments are made weekly, typically net 60 days from invoice receipt.  
- Preferred payment methods include Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or virtual cards.

### Mandatory Procurement Engagement Points

- Procurement must be engaged before any purchase or contract agreement, especially for spend over $25,000 or new vendors.  
- RFPs are required for new spend, vendor changes, or renewals after three years, scaled by spend amount.

## Contract Management and Negotiation

### Multi-Step Contract Review and Approval Process

- Procurement drafts or receives contracts and submits them to the Legal Procurement Team for review.  
- Legal ensures contracts comply with GitLab policies, laws, and data protection regulations.  
- Security and Privacy teams review contracts involving sensitive data or system access.  
- Procurement negotiates commercial terms, especially for significant spend, and routes contracts through Coupa for final approvals.  
- Final approvals involve FP&A, functional, and executive teams before contract execution.

### Key Contract Components

- **Statement of Work (SOW):** Defines tasks, deliverables, and milestones.  
- **Data Processing Agreement (DPA):** Ensures compliance with privacy laws when personal data is involved.  
- **Terms and Conditions (T&Cs):** Cover indemnification, liability, payment terms, confidentiality, and governing law.

### Negotiation Practices

- Procurement leads negotiations for SaaS contracts over $25,000 and one-time contracts over $100,000.  
- Strategies include securing scalable pricing, volume discounts, SLAs, and favorable payment terms.  
- Collaboration with Legal, Privacy, Security, and business units is essential.

### Accessing Standard Templates and Legal Documents

- All templates and legal documents are available in the **“Helpful Documents and Templates”** section of the Procurement Handbook.  
- Use these templates as baselines to ensure consistency and compliance.  
- Upload finalized contracts to ContractWorks for record-keeping.

## Vendor Management and Relationships

### Vendor Lifecycle Stages

1. **Initial Vendor Vetting and Selection:**  
   Conduct RFPs, financial viability checks, IT and Legal reviews, and responsible sourcing assessments.

2. **Vendor Onboarding and System Integration:**  
   Create vendor profiles in Zip, Coupa, and NetSuite; collect banking and tax information directly from suppliers.

3. **Ongoing Vendor Management:**  
   Conduct quarterly business reviews, monitor performance, manage renewals, and drive cost savings.

4. **Vendor Offboarding:**  
   Coordinate contract termination, service transition, and system deactivation.

### Vendor Segmentation

- Vendors are classified into Strategic, Niche, Commodity, and Transactional tiers, influencing contract complexity, review frequency, and management focus.

### Renewal and Quarterly Business Reviews

- Renewals are planned quarterly with business stakeholders, prioritizing vendors based on tier and spend.  
- RFPs are mandatory for new spend or contracts renewed beyond three years.

## Specialized Procurement Categories

### Contingent Workers

- Includes staff augmentation, consultants, and independent contractors.  
- Engagements have duration limits (e.g., 24 months max for staff augmentation with mandatory breaks).

- Procurement involvement varies by spend thresholds.

### Software Purchases (Including Individual Use Software)

- Individual use software must be pre-approved or submitted via designated forms.  
- Annual spend per user capped at $5,000; above this requires standard procurement processes.  
- IT and Privacy reviews are mandatory for new vendors or sensitive data handling.  
- Payments processed via Navan virtual cards; personal reimbursements are not allowed.

### Large Internal Events

- Events with budgets over $1 million require early planning (18-24 months).  
- Collaboration with Procurement Category Managers and FP&A is critical.  
- Detailed budgets and strict contract approval protocols apply.

### Non-Cost Related Agreements, Demos, and Trials

- Submit via Zip using the “Request a Demo/Trial ($0 Contracts)” workflow.
