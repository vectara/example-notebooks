    "            **Methodology:** Participants were randomized into two arms. The experimental arm (n=1,250) received a 100mg daily dose of Solara, \n",
    "            while the control arm (n=1,250) received a visually identical placebo. \n",

Participants were randomized to receive either a 100mg daily dose of Solara or placebo, and data was collected via electronic patient diaries and quarterly clinic visits. The primary endpoint was the mean reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) from baseline to the final 6-month period.
