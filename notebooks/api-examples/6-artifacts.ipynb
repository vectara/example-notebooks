    "# Vectara Artifacts: Working with Files in Agent Sessions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Vectara's **Artifacts** feature to work with files in agent sessions. Artifacts enable agents to access and process files without storing them permanently in a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to:\n",
    "1. Upload files (PDFs, images, documents) to an agent session\n",
    "2. List artifacts in a session\n",
    "3. Retrieve artifact details and content\n",
    "4. Create agents with artifact-processing tools\n",
    "5. Have agents analyze uploaded files and generate new artifacts"

    "In Vectara, Artifacts are **session-specific file storage** that enable agents to work with files on-the-fly:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporary Storage**: Files persist within a session without permanent indexing\n",
    "- **Multi-Modal Support**: Handle PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, and images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)\n",
    "- **Session Scope**: Artifacts remain attached to their specific session\n",
    "- **Two-Way Flow**: Users can upload files, and agents can generate new artifacts"
