      "Quantum computing uses qubits instead of classical bits. IBM and Google have built quantum computers. This technology represents a significant shift from classical computing, which relies on bits that are either 0 or 1. In contrast, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for potentially more powerful computations. However, the detailed history, specific milestones, and comparisons to classical computing were not covered in the source information.\n",
