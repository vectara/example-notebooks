* A charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding $5 million [1]
* A director, executive officer, or general partner of the company selling the securities [1]
* A business in which all the equity owners are accredited investors [1]
* A natural person who has individual net worth, or joint net worth with the person's spouse, that exceeds $1 million at the time of the purchase, excluding the value of the primary residence of such person [1]

Additionally, accredited investors are required to have:

* $1 million in assets (not including primary residence) or $200,000/yr income for the last 3 years [3]

It's worth noting that being an accredited investor does not necessarily mean that one is a member of the management team [2], and holding stock in a company does not automatically make one an accredited investor with that company [4].

Training workers is not their job - they're building software.

However, some sources suggest that job training is not always necessary or effective, and that some jobs can be learned quickly and do not require formal training. [2] Additionally, some sources criticize the quality of job training programs and the high cost of education, which can lead to a surplus of minimally qualified applicants and drive down wages in certain fields.

Moreover, FSA plan sponsors can limit what they are will to reimburse.  While you can't use a health FSA for premiums, you could previously use a 125 cafeteria plan to pay premiums, but it had to be a separate election from the health FSA. However, under N. 2013-54, even using a cafeteria plan to pay for indivdiual premiums is effectively prohibited.","Based on the provided sources, the answer to the query ""Can you use the FSA in a cafeteria?"" is:

No, you cannot use a health FSA in a cafeteria plan to pay for individual health insurance premiums. This is because the cafeteria plan rules require that a health FSA provide uniform coverage throughout the coverage period, and the maximum amount of reimbursement from a health FSA must be available at all times during the coverage period [2]. Additionally, the IRS has prohibited using a cafeteria plan to pay for individual premiums [1].

However, you can use a flexible spending account (FSA) in a cafeteria plan to pay for dependent care expenses, as well as medical expenses [3].

36f1fdc3-887b-45d8-858d-4fb66390cbc1,can you use the fsa in a cafeteria,[2]," Edit: Let's forget about Wikipedia.  From the horse's mouth: The cafeteria plan rules require that a health FSA provide uniform coverage throughout the    coverage period (which is the period when the employee is covered by the plan).  See Proposed    Treasury Regulations Section 1.125-5(d).  Under the uniform coverage rules, the maximum amount    of reimbursement from a health FSA must be available at all times during the coverage period.  This    means that the employee’s entire health FSA election is available from the first day of the plan year    to reimburse qualified medical expenses incurred during the coverage period.  The cafeteria plan    may not, therefore, base its reimbursements to an employee on what that employee may have    contributed up to any particular date, such as the date the employee is laid-off or terminated.  Thus,    if an employee’s reimbursements from the health FSA exceed his contributions to the health FSA at    the time of lay-off or termination, the employer cannot recoup the difference from the employee. (emphasis added)  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-wd/1012060.pdf Uniform Coverage Rule The IRS has required that “health FSAS must qualify as accident or health plans. This means    that, in general, while the health coverage under the FSA need not be provided through a    commercial insurance contract, health FSAS must exhibit the risk-shifting and risk-distribution    characteristics of insurance.” This concept has led to the “uniform coverage” rule.  The uniform­coverage rule requires that the maximum amount of an employee’s projected    elective contributions to a health FSA must be available from the first day of the plan year to    reimburse the employee’s qualified medical expenses, regardless of the amount actually    contributed to the plan at the time that reimbursement is sought.  Citing proposed Treasury Regulations Section  the IRS General Counsel has    determined that:  “Under the uniform coverage rules, the maximum amount of reimbursement from    a health FSA must be available at all times during the coverage period. The    cafeteria plan may not, therefore, base its reimbursements to an employee on what    that employee may have contributed up to any particular date, such as the date the    employee is laid-off or terminated. Thus, if an employee’s reimbursements from    the health FSA exceed his contributions to the health FSA at the time of  or    termination, the employer cannot recoup the difference from the employee.”  This rule is unfair and also constitutes a disincentive to establishing FSAS because of the    exposure to out-of pocket expenditures arising from employees who leave the company.  NSBA believes that the uniform coverage rule should also be revised if the  or lose-   it rule is changed. Revising the use-it or lose-it rule while leaving the uniform coverage rule unchanged will introduce an inappropriate asymmetry to FSAS. An employer should    be allowed to deduct any negative amount arising from insuftîcient employee    contributions from a terminating partieipant’s last paycheck. http://www.ecfc.org/files/legislative-news/NSBA_(David_Burton).pdf (emphasis added)  Now, that's some fresh bitterness for you right there.

A flexible spending account has its advantage as well: You can use it for dependent care as well as medical expenses, but it's part of a cafeteria plan and you lose the money that you don't spend by the end of the year (rather than it simply rolling over to the next). Another benefit in a FSA is that if you allocate 200/mo to it, and you need to get surgery in January that costs 2400 dollars and then you lose your job in February, you just got 2400 dollars of surgery for 200 dollars pre-tax :) In summary: Move to France for real health care :) just kidding",

8c2a0338-109a-411e-8303-5eb168b1037c,how long to wait until you change to a balanced option,[1]," My super fund and I would say many other funds give you one free switch of strategies per year.  Some suggest you should change from high growth option to a more balance option once you are say about 10 to 15 years from retirement, and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement. This is a more passive approach and has benefits as well as disadvantages. The benefit is that there is not much work involved, you just change your investment option based on your life stage, 2 to 3 times during your lifetime. This allows you to take more risk when you are young to aim for higher returns, take a balanced approach with moderate risk and returns during the middle part of your working life, and take less risk with lower returns (above inflation) during the latter part of your working life. A possible disadvantage of this strategy is you may be in the higher risk/ higher growth option during a market correction and then change to a more balanced option just when the market starts to pick up again. So your funds will be hit with large losses whilst the market is in retreat and just when things look to be getting better you change to a more balanced portfolio and miss out on the big gains. A second more active approach would be to track the market and change investment option as the market changes. One approach which shouldn't take much time is to track the index such as the ASX200 (if you investment option is mainly invested in the Australian stock market) with a 200 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The concept is that if the index crosses above the 200 day SMA the market is bullish and if it crosses below it is bearish. See the chart below:  This strategy will work well when the market is trending up or down but not very well when the market is going sideways, as you will be changing from aggressive to balanced and back too often. Possibly a more appropriate option would be a combination of the two. Use the first passive approach to change investment option from aggressive to balanced to capital guaranteed with your life stages, however use the second active approach to time the change. For example, if you were say in your late 40s now and were looking to change from aggressive to balanced in the near future, you could wait until the ASX200 crosses below the 200 day SMA before making the change. This way you could capture the majority of the uptrend (which could go on for years) before changing from the high growth/aggressive option to the balanced option. If you where after more control over your superannuation assets another option open to you is to start a SMSF, however I would recommend having at least $300K to $400K in assets before starting a SMSF, or else the annual costs would be too high as a percentage of your total super assets.","Based on the provided sources, the answer to the query ""how long to wait until you change to a balanced option"" is not explicitly stated. However, source [1] provides some guidance on when to consider changing from a high growth option to a more balanced option. It suggests that one approach is to change from a high growth option to a more balanced option around 10-15 years from retirement, and then change to a more capital guaranteed option a few years from retirement [1].

Additionally, source [1] mentions that another approach is to track the market and change investment options as the market changes, using a combination of passive and active strategies [1]. This approach involves waiting until the market is in a certain state before making a change, such as waiting until the ASX200 crosses below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) before changing from a high growth/aggressive option to a balanced option [1].

It's worth noting that the other sources ([2], [3], and [4]) do not provide relevant information to answer the query. Source [2] discusses tax and penalty options, source [3] discusses European and American options, and source [4] discusses the pricing of options in a random walk process. Source [5] provides general guidance on investing, but does not specifically address the query.

Therefore, the answer to the query is not explicitly stated in the provided sources, but source [1] provides some guidance on when to consider changing from a high growth option to a more balanced option."
8c2a0338-109a-411e-8303-5eb168b1037c,how long to wait until you change to a balanced option,[2], This all comes down to time: You can spend the maximum on taxes and penalties and have your money now.  Or you can wait about a decade and not pay a cent in taxes or penalties. Consider (assuming no other us income and 2017 tax brackets which we know will change): Option 1 (1 year): Take all the money next year and pay the taxes and penalty: Option 2 (2 years): Spread it out to barely exceed the 10% bracket: Option 3 (6 years): Spread it out to cover your Standard Deduction each year: Option 4 (6-11 years): Same as Option 3 but via a Roth Conversion Ladder:,
8c2a0338-109a-411e-8303-5eb168b1037c,how long to wait until you change to a balanced option,[3]," Conceptually, yes, you need to worry about it.  As a practical matter, it's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior. The way to think about paying a European option is: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike is in the money at expiry] Whereas the American option can be thought of as: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike price is in the money at expiry] + ( [odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry] * [odds that other party will exercise early] ). This is just a heuristic, not a formal financial tool.  But the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early, for how long (maybe over multiple periods), and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early. Important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side (long, straddle, quick turnaround), the length of time the option is in the money early, and the anticipated future movement. A quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around.  But that could leave further gains on the table, so it's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement.  This sort of counter-market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike, and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option.  So most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff. A long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise, and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option (the choice to get out of the option, if it goes back to being unprofitable).  So it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early.  The same goes for a straddle, if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position. So you're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the American option.  That may include people who really want to close a position, take their money, and move on.  In some cases, it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity, so they close positions.  But for the most part, it's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table.  The time value of an option dwindles at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely, especially if the option is fairly deep in the money (the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money). So early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches.  Otherwise, it's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition.",
8c2a0338-109a-411e-8303-5eb168b1037c,how long to wait until you change to a balanced option,[4]," If you're into math, do this thought experiment: Consider the outcome X of a random walk process (a stock doesn't behave this way, but for understanding the question you asked, this is useful): On the first day, X=some integer X1. On each subsequent day, X goes up or down by 1 with probability 1/2. Let's think of buying a call option on X. A European option with a strike price of S that expires on day N, if held until that day and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y = min(X[N]-S, 0). This has an expected value E[Y] that you could actually calculate. (should be related to the binomial distribution, but my probability & statistics hat isn't working too well today) The market value V[k] of that option on day #k, where 1 < k < N, should be V[k] = E[Y]|X[k], which you can also actually calculate. On day #N, V[N] = Y. (the value is known) An American option, if held until day #k and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y[k] = min(X[k]-S, 0).  For the moment, forget about selling the option on the market. (so, the choices are either exercise it on some day #k, or letting it expire) Let's say it's day k=N-1.  If X[N-1] >= S+1 (in the money), then you have two choices: exercise today, or exercise tomorrow if profitable. The expected value is the same. (Both are equal to X[N-1]-S). So you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere. If X[N-1] <= S-1 (out of the money), the expected value is 0, whether you exercise today, when you know it's worthless, or if you wait until tomorrow, when the best case is if X[N-1]=S-1 and X[N] goes up to S, so the option is still worthless. But if X[N-1] = S (at the money), here's where it gets interesting. If you exercise today, it's worth 0. If wait until tomorrow, there's a 1/2 chance it's worth 0 (X[N]=S-1), and a 1/2 chance it's worth 1 (X[N]=S+1). Aha! So the expected value is 1/2. Therefore you should wait until tomorrow. Now let's say it's day k=N-2.  Similar situation, but more choices: If X[N-2] >= S+2, you can either sell it today, in which case you know the value = X[N-2]-S, or you can wait until tomorrow, when the expected value is also X[N-2]-S. Again, you might as well exercise it now. If X[N-2] <= S-2, you know the option is worthless. If X[N-2] = S-1, it's worth 0 today, whereas if you wait until tomorrow, it's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up (X[N-1]=S), or 0 if it goes down, for a net expected value of 1/4, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S, it's worth 0 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up, or 0 if it goes down -> net expected value of 1/2, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S+1, it's worth 1 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up, or 1/2 if it goes down (X[N-1]=S) -> net expected value of 1.25, so you should wait. If it's day k=N-3, and X[N-3] >= S+3 then E[Y] = X[N-3]-S and you should exercise it now; or if X[N-3] <= S-3 then E[Y]=0.  But if X[N-3] = S+2 then there's an expected value E[Y] of (3+1.25)/2 = 2.125 if you wait until tomorrow, vs. exercising it now with a value of 2; if X[N-3] = S+1 then E[Y] = (2+0.5)/2 = 1.25, vs. exercise value of 1; if X[N-3] = S then E[Y] = (1+0.5)/2 = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-1 then E[Y] = (0.5 + 0)/2 = 0.25, vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-2 then E[Y] = (0.25 + 0)/2 = 0.125, vs. exercise value of 0.

The market value of the option on day #k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait. It should be possible to show that the expected value of an American option on X is greater than the expected value of a European option on X. The intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money, the option should be exercised early  (or sold), something a European option doesn't allow, whereas if it is nearly at the money, the option should be held, whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money, the option is definitely worthless. As far as real securities go, they're not random walks (or at least, the probabilities are time-varying and more complex), but there should be analogous situations. And if there's ever a high probability a stock will go down, it's time to exercise/sell an in-the-money American option, whereas you can't do that with a European option. edit: ...what do you know: the computation I gave above for the random walk isn't too different conceptually from the Binomial options pricing model.",

Derivatives are called such because their payoffs depend on the price of other assets (financial or real). Other kinds of derivatives are call options, put options. Fixed income assets that mimic the behavior of derivatives are callable bonds, puttable bonds etc.  A futures contract is a contract that specifies the following: Just like with any other contract, there are two parties involved. One party commits to delivering the underlying asset to the other party on expiration date in exchange for the futures price. The other party commits to paying the futures price in exchange for the asset. There is no price that any of the two parties pay upfront to engage in the contract. The language used is so that the agent committing to receiving the delivery of the underlying asset is said to have bought the contract. The agent that commits to make the delivery is said to have sold the contract.  So answer your question, buying on June 1 a futures contract at the futures price of $100, with a maturity date on August 1 means you commit to paying $100 for the underlying asset on August 1. You don't have to pay anything upfront. Futures price is simply what the contract prescribes the underlying asset will exchange hands for.",No result found.
16eedd42-c42b-4cfe-bb07-b1937473c1a3,what is the futures contract called,[2]," ""Buying (or selling) a futures contract means that you are entering into a contractual agreement to buy (or sell) the contracted commodity or financial instrument in the contracted amount (the contract size) at the price you have bought (or sold) the contract on the contract expire date (maturity date).  It is important to understand that futures contracts are tradeable instruments, meaning that you are free to sell (or buy back) your contract at any time before the expiry date. For example, if you buy 1 """"lot"""" (1 contract) of a gold future on the Comex exchange for the contract month of December 2016, then you entering into a contract to buy 100 ounces (the contract size) of gold at the price at which you buy the contract - not the spot price on the day of expiry when the contract comes to maturity.  The December 2016 gold futures contract has an expiry date of 28 December.  You are free to trade this contract at any time before its expiry by selling it back to another market participant.  If you sell the contract at a price higher than you have purchased it, then you will realise a profit of 100 times the difference between the price you bought the contract and the price you sold the contract, where 100 is the contract size of the gold contract.  Similarly, if you sell the contract at a price lower than the price you have purchased it, then you will realise a loss. (Commissions paid will also effect your net profit or loss). If you hold your contract until the expiry date and exercise your contract by taking (or making) delivery, then you are obliged to buy (or sell) 100 ounces of gold at the price at which you bought (or sold) the contract - not the current spot price. So long as your contract is """"open"""" (i.e., prior to the expiry date and so long as you own the contract) you are required to make a """"good faith deposit"""" to show that you intend to honour your contractual obligations.  This deposit is usually called """"initial margin"""".  Typically, the initial margin amount will be about 2% of the total contract value for the gold contract.  So if you buy (or sell) one contract for 100 ounces of gold at, say, $1275 an ounce, then the total contract value will be $127,500 and your deposit requirement would be about $2,500.  The initial margin is returned to you when you sell (or buy) back your futures contract, or when you exercise your contract on expiry. In addition to initial margin, you will be required to maintain a second type of margin called """"variation margin"""".  The variation margin is the running profit or loss you are showing on your open contract. For the sake of simplicity, lets look only at the case where you have purchased a futures contract.  If the futures price is higher than your contract (buy) price, then you are showing a profit on your current position and this profit (the variation margin) will be used to offset your initial margin requirement. Conversely, if the futures price has dropped below your contracted (buy) price, then you will be showing a loss on your open position and this loss (the variation margin) will be added to your initial margin and you will be called to put up more money in order to show good faith that you intend to honour your obligations.  Note that neither the initial margin nor the variation margin are accounting items.  In other words, these are not postings that are debited or credited to the ledger in your trading account.  So in some sense """"you don't have to pay anything upfront"""", but you do need to put up a refundable deposit to show good faith.""",

A futures contract commits two parties to a buy/sell of the underlying securities, but with a futures contract you also create leverage because generally the margin you post on your futures contract is not sufficient to pay for the collateral in the underlying contract. The person buying the future is essentially """"borrowing"""" money while the person selling the future is essentially """"lending"""" money.

16eedd42-c42b-4cfe-bb07-b1937473c1a3,what is the futures contract called,[4]," In order to understand how much you might gain or lose from participating in the futures markets, it is important to first understand the different ways in which the slope of the futures markets can be described. In many of the futures markets there is a possibility of somebody buying a commodity at the spot price and selling a futures contract on it. In order to do this they need to hold the commodity in storage. Most commodities cost money to hold in storage, so the futures price will tend to be above the spot price for these commodities.  In the case of stock index futures, the holder receives a potential benefit from holding the stocks in an index.   If the futures market is upward sloping compared to the spot price, then it can be called normal. If the futures market is usually downward sloping compared to the spot price then it can be called inverted. If the futures market is high enough above the spot price so that more of the commodity gets stored for the future, then the market can be called in contango. If the futures market is below the point where the commodity can be profitably stored for the future, and the market can be called in backwardation. In many of these cases, there is an implicit cost that the buyer of a future pays in order to hold the contract for certainly time. Your question is how much money you make if the price of gold goes up by a specific amount, or how much money you lose if the price of gold goes down by the same specific amount.  The problem is, you do not say whether it is the spot price or the futures price which goes up or down.  In most cases it is assumed that the change in the futures price will be similar to the change in the spot price of gold.  If the spot price of gold goes up by a small amount, then the futures price of gold will go up by a small amount as well.  If the futures price of gold goes up by a small amount, this will also drive the spot price of gold up.  Even for these small price changes, the expected futures price change in expected spot price change will not be exactly the same.  For larger price changes, there will be more of a difference between the expected spot price change in expected future price change.   If the price eventually goes up, then the cost of holding the contract will be subtracted from any future gains.  If the price eventually goes down, then this holding cost should be added to the losses.  If you bought the contract when it was above the spot price, the price will slowly drift toward the spot price, causing you this holding cost.  If the price of gold does not change any from the current spot price, then all you are left with is this holding cost.",

Anyway in this one example the s&p 500 futures contract has an """"initial margin"""" of $19,250, meaning that is how much it would cost you to establish that contract. Futures generally require delivery of 1,000 units of the underlying asset. So you would take the underlying asset's price and multiple it by 1,000. (what price you use is also mentioned in the contract specification), The S&P 500 index  is $1588 you mentioned, so on Jun2013 you would have to delivery $1588 x 1000, or $1,588,000. GREAT NEWS, you only have to put up 1.2% in principal to control a 1.5 million dollar asset! Although, if even that amount is too great, you can look at the E-Mini S&P futures, which require about 1/10th the capital and delivery.

From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as """"goodwill."""") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.""","To find the stock price based on NAV, you need to understand that the stock price is not simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares [1]. The stock price reflects the NAV, but also investors' expectations looking into the future [1]. 

The NAV is the total value of the company's assets divided by the number of shares, also known as book value [3]. The market cap, on the other hand, is the share price times the number of shares [3]. 

For example, if a company has a NAV of 22 and a market cap of 290, the P/B (price to book ratio) would be 13, indicating that investors believe the company is worth more than its book value [3]. 

In the case of mutual funds, the price is set at the end of each day and doesn't fluctuate during the day, so the order is executed based on the NAV calculated at the end of that trading day [5]. 

In summary, to find the stock price based on NAV, you need to consider the NAV, market cap, and investors' expectations, and understand that the stock price is not simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares.

Canadian importers will have to buy RMB (typically with CAD) to pay for their orders and Canadian exporters can take payment in RMB if they wish, or set prices in CAD. By avoiding the US dollar middleman the transactions are made less risky and incur less costs. Japan did this many decades ago (they, too, used to price their products in USD).  This is important in transactions of large amounts, not so much for the tiny amounts associated with tourism. Two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn.  Of course Forex trading may greatly exceed the actual amounts required for trade- the world Forex market is at least an order of magnitude greater than size of real international trade. All that trading in currency and financial instruments means more jobs on Bay Street and more money flowing into a very vital part of the Canadian economy.

In fact, two-way annual trade between China and Canada is in excess of $70bn, making it an important part of the Canadian economy [1]. By trading in CNY, Canadian importers can benefit from the appreciation of the CNY, which can make goods from other countries more competitive and imports from China more expensive [3]. This can lead to a shift in trade patterns, with Canadian importers potentially sourcing more from countries that use the CNY as their currency [3]."

Assuming Shopify is only offering a single class of shares to the public in the IPO (and Shopify's form F-1 only mentions Class A subordinate voting shares as being offered) then the shares that will trade on the TSX and NYSE will be the same class, i.e. identical. Consequently, the primary difference will be the currency in which they are quoted and trade. This adds another dimension to possible arbitrage, where not only the bare price could deviate between exchanges, but also due to currency fluctuation. An additional implication for a company to maintain such a dual listing is that they'll need to adhere to the requirements of both the TSX and NYSE. While this may have a hard cost in terms of additional filing requirements etc., in theory they will benefit from the additional liquidity provided by having the multiple listings. Canadians, in particular, are more likely to invest in a Canadian company when it has a TSX listing quoted in CAD. Also, for a company listed on both the TSX and NYSE, I would expect the TSX listing would be more likely to yield inclusion in a significant market index—say, one based on market capitalization, and thus benefit the company by having its shares purchased by index ETFs and index mutual funds that track the index. I'll also remark that this dual U.S./Canadian exchange listing is not uncommon when it comes to Canadian companies that have significant business outside of Canada.",

And it would make imports from these countries to China more expensive.  The below illustration is just with 2 major currencies and is more illustrative to show the effect. It does not actually mean the goods from these countries would be cheaper. 1 GBP = 1.60 USD  1 EUR = 1.40 USD 1 CNY = 0.15 USD Lets say the above are the rates for GBP, EUR, CNY. The cost of a particular goods (assume Pencils) in international market is 2 USD. This means for the cost of manufacturing this should be less than GBP 1.25 in UK, less than 1.43 in Euro Countires, less than 13.33 CNY in China. Only then export would make sense. If the real cost of manufacturing is say 1.4 GBP in UK, 1.5 EUR in Euro countires, clearly they cannot compete and would loose. Now lets say the USD has appreciated by 20% against other currencies. The CNY is at same rate. 1 GBP = 1.28 USD 1 EUR = 1.12 USD 1 CNY = 0.15 USD Now at this rate the cost of manufacturing should be less than GBP 1.56 GBP, less than 1.78 EUR in Euro Countires. In effect this is more than the cost of manufacturing. So in effect the goods from other countires have become cheaper/compatative and goods from China have become expensive. Similarly the imports from these countires to China would be more expensive.",

If you look at this, it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports. For the specific case of Canada, the exports would become costlier, because of a costlier dollar, but at the same time imports would become cheaper. This is only a generalization, not specific goodswise, which would require a more detailed ananlysis. But investors have a different dilemma. Canadian investors would find  it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada. While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else.  Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates, if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada. But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict, because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do. But the basic gist is Canadian exporters will be sad and Canadian importers will be happy, but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in Canada.",
