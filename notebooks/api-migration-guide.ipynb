    "# Vectara Guide: APIv2\n",
    "\n",
    "In early June 2024, we [announced](https://vectara.com/blog/introducing-vectaras-v2-api/) a new API v2 for Vectara.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara’s API has been rich and capable in [APIv1](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/1.0/), but it was somewhat complex to work with. We have heard this from many developers, and have worked hard over the last few months go improve that, resulting in the launch of [APIv2](https://docs.vectara.com/docs) - a new and improved API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new version provides APIs that are much more RESTful, and follow the [resource-oriented design](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resources) methodology. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore the new APIs, and demonstrate the differences between APIv1 and APIv2 for some of the key operations."

    "## Understanding Vectara API V2\n",
    "\n",
    "Being more resource-oriented, API v2 follows the object-oriented URL structure. This design philosophy makes using APIs much easier by integrating a few key ideas:\n",
    "1. **Entities as Resources**: Entities like documents, corpora, or api keys are defined as resources\n",
    "2. **Nouns not Verbs**: Resource names are nouns (e.g. \"corpus\") and not verbs (e.g. \"getKeys\")\n",
    "3. **Correct use of HTTP**: Using the standard HTTP verbs in a way that is consistent with their intent\n",
    "- *GET*: Retrieve a resource or a collection of resources\n",
    "- *POST*: Create a new resource\n",
    "- *PUT*: Update an existing resource\n",
    "- *DELETE*: Remove a resource\n",
    "- *PATCH*: Partially update a resource\n",
    "4. **Hierarchy**: Reflect the hierarchical nature of resources (e.g., /corpora/{corpusKey}/documents/)\n",
    "5. **Error**: Last but not least, make good of HTTP error codes in a proper manner\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from this big shift into resource-oriented design, here are a few other key changes:\n",
    "1. **Updated defaults**: We've take the opportunity to update some of the default values in the API where it makes sense\n",
    "2. **URL encoding**: In APIv2 many requests include more information in the URL, and thus you might need to percent-encode those to ensure they are valid in the URL"

    "A few things to notice:\n",
    "1. The overall structure of the payload has changed. In APIv2, there is no longer a `document` section. Also, you do not need to specify your `customer_id` or `corpus_id`. These are implemented through the URL and header fields.\n",
    "2. While APIv1 uses `metadataJson` to store document and section metadata, which needs to be a string representation of the metadata dictionary. In contrast, APIv2 simplifies this and uses `metadata` which allows you to just use a dictionary of metadata for each document and section. The APIv2 layout is better organized for users and eliminates the need to escape quotations.\n",
    "3. Other field names have changed as well, such as: `documentId` -> `id` and `section` -> `sections`.\n",
    "4. APIv2 now enforces that each `section` has `text` (this argument was optional for APIv1). For both versions, all other `section` parameters are optional.\n",
    "5. For the APIv2 example, our code uses the `structured` document type. This is the most commonly used type when indexing a document because it allows users to divide the document by the explicit sections in the document and let Vectara perform the chunking of text for the best model performance. We also support the `core` document type in which you as the developer explicitly define how the document is chunked. You can read more about the different types of documents [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/indexing-apis/indexing#core-document-object-definition)."

    "1. With APIv1, we use a POST operator, using the same general command structure as any other type of query in APIv1 (see others below). It is also required to specify `numResults` and a list of `corpusKey` even though we only want to search a single corpus. With APIv2, we use a completely separate command. Instead of using a POST, which is typically used to create a new resource, we use the more appropriate GET operator to simply pull information from our corpus. This is accomplished in a concise manner by simply encoding the URL with the corpus key and the query. That's it! Note how we used the `quote` method of urllib.parse to ensure the query is encoded properly.\n",
    "3. The APIv2 URL is as you expect from a resource-oriented design: identifying the corpus as `/corpora/{corpus_key}` and then running the query on that corpus. That is also why we don't need to specify the `corpusKey` as we had to do with APIv1."

    "- The `query` string itself is a separate variable and we have `search` and `generation` as separate sub-dictionaries.\n",
    "- Names have been changed: for example `maxSummarizedResults` -> `max_used_search_results`, `summarizerPromptName` -> `prompt_name` and `responseLang` -> `response_language`.\n",
    "- `response_language` now only supports [ISO 693-3](https://iso639-3.sil.org/code_tables/639/data), so for example, for English you can only use `eng` (`en`, the 693-1 code won't work). When you migrate to APIv2 please use the playground and documentation to make sure you use the API in the way intended and notice any naming changes that are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The outputs in APIv2 are also easier to work with. For example the summary text is available as `res[\"summary\"]` \n",
    "\n",
    "4. We also included the `factual_consistency_score` in our output, which provides the probability that the generated answer is factually consistent with the search results. You can learn about the factual consistency score [here](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/stream-query#factual-consistency-score).\n",

We have greatly simplified this in APIv2 by creating a boolean flag `stream_response` to be used with both types of queries that allow generative summarization: [corpus query](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/query-corpus) or [query corpora](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/rest-api/query) request.

    "Some key takeaways:\n",
    "1. First notice that in the second turn, we asked \"What makes **them** special?\". Based on our first turn, \"Are *velociraptors* allowed in the office?\", Vectara knows that **them** refers to *velociraptors*. However, if you look at the two responses, APIv1's response talks about multiple animals from the initial response, such as alligators while APIv2's response is correctly focused on velociraptors, providing a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "2. Take a look at the urls for each request. In APIv1, we are still using a query, just as we did for the simple corpus query and corpus query. We differentiate a chat from other query types by adding a `chat` parameter in the `summmary` section. Furthermore, we differentiate the creation of a new chat and a chat turn by the parameter `conversationId`. In contrast, APIv2 distinguishes chats in the request url, making it clearer that this is a turn in a chat and not an individual query."

    "Some takeaways:\n",
    "1. The `status_code` in the response indicates whether or not the request was successful, and if not, where the issue occurred:\n",
    "   - A response code in the 200's indicates that the request was successful\n",
    "   - A response code in the 400's indicates that the request was unsuccessful due to an issue with the request body (often a syntax error in the request)\n",
    "   - A response code in the 500's indicates that the request was unsuccessful due to an issue at the server level\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. APIv1 breaks up the response into a `code`, `statusDetail`, and `cause`, and in some cases response with a 200 code only to have the actual status code and text inside the `statusDetail` section. The response from APIv2 is more succinct than APIv1, providing a single, easy to understand message, and adhering correctly to status_code best practices."
