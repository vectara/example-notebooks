    "## About Vectara\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted GenAI RAG-as-a-service platform, providing a simple API for enterprise developers to created RAG applications that are enterprise ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Vectara API documentation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefits for using Vectara for a RAG application are:\n",
    "* **Easy to use**: Vectara provides an end-to-end, fully functional, highly scalable and robust RAG pipeline, so as a user you don't have to code up these pieces and maintain them over time.\n",
    "* **Scalable and Secure**: building GenAI applications may seem easy at first, but the DIY approach can become overwhelming beyond simple examples. Vectara provides instant scalablility to millions of documents, while maintaing data security and privacy, as well as latency SLAs."

    "## About Vectara-Agentic\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG is a method that combines the strengths of RAG with autonomous agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "With vanilla RAG, Vectara receives a user query, retrieves the most relevant facts from your data, and uses an LLM to generate the most accurate response based on those facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG leverages an LLM to “manage” the process of answering the user query via reasoning, planning, and a provided set of “tools”. Since a “manager” LLM-powered agent is in charge, it is smart enough to analyze the user query and properly call tools to obtain a comprehensive response to a complex user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara-agentic](https://vectara.github.io/vectara-agentic-docs/index.html) is a Python package that allows you to build Agentic RAG applications quickly with Vectara. "
