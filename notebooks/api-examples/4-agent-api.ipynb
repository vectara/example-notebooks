    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the Agent Operating System for trusted enterprise AI: a unified Agentic RAG platform with built-in multi-modal retrieval, orchestration, and always-on governance. Deploy it on-prem (air-gapped), in your VPC, or as SaaS. Vectara agents deliver grounded answers and safe actions with source citations, step-level audit trails, fine-grained access controls, and real-time policy and factual-consistency enforcement, so teams ship faster with lower risk, and with trusted, production-grade AI agents at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara provides a complete API-first platform for building production RAG and agentic applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Integration**: RESTful APIs and SDKs (Python, JavaScript) for quick integration into any stack\n",
    "- **Flexible Deployment**: Choose SaaS, VPC, or on-premises deployment based on your security requirements\n",
    "- **Multi-Modal Support**: Index and search across text, tables, and images from PDFs, documents, and structured data\n",
    "- **Advanced Retrieval**: Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching with state-of-the-art reranking\n",
    "- **Grounded Generation**: LLM responses with citations and factual consistency scores to reduce hallucinations\n",
    "- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built-in access controls, audit logging, and compliance (SOC2, HIPAA) from day one"

      "Imagine you're shopping online for a new laptop. You type in the search query \"lightweight laptop with long battery life.\" A hybrid search system would process this query using both semantic and keyword-based approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Semantic Search**: The system understands the intent behind your query. It recognizes that \"lightweight\" refers to the physical weight of the laptop and \"long battery life\" refers to the duration the laptop can operate on a single charge. It uses this understanding to prioritize laptops that are known for these features, even if the exact words \"lightweight\" or \"long battery life\" aren't explicitly mentioned in the product descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Keyword Search**: Simultaneously, the system performs a traditional keyword search to find products that explicitly mention \"lightweight\" and \"long battery life\" in their descriptions or specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "By combining these approaches, the hybrid search system can return a list of laptops that not only match the keywords but also align with the semantic intent of your query. This results in a more relevant and satisfying search experience, as you're more likely to find laptops that truly meet your needs, even if the product descriptions use different terminology to describe the features you're interested in.\n"
