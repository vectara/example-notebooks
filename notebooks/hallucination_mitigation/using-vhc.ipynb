    "            The study involved 2,500 participants across 50 sites in North America and Europe over a period of 24 months. \\n\\n\n",
    "            **Methodology:** Participants were randomized into two arms. The experimental arm (n=1,250) received a 100mg daily dose of Solara, \n",
    "            while the control arm (n=1,250) received a visually identical placebo. \n",
