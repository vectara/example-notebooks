    "In spite of the amazing power of LLMs, they still do hallucinate. In some cases, where creativity is required, hallucinations are okay or even necessary, but in most enterprise use-cases a trusted response is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "HHEM (Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model) is a model that was built specifically to help LLM practitioners measure hallucinations. It is available for use on [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/vectara/hallucination_evaluation_model), and a public [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/vectara/leaderboard) shows the likelihood of various LLMs (both commercial and open source) to hallucinate.\n",
