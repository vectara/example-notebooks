The study involved 2,500 participants across 50 sites in North America and Europe over a period of 24 months. The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Participants were randomized into two arms: the experimental arm received a 100mg daily dose of Solara, and the control arm received a visually identical placebo. The primary endpoint was the mean reduction in monthly migraine days (MMD) from baseline to the final 6-month period. Secondary endpoints included a 50% responder rate and changes in the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score. Data was collected via electronic patient diaries and quarterly clinic visits. Statistical analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model. The primary endpoint was met with high statistical significance (p < 0.001). The Solara group experienced a mean reduction of 8.2 monthly migraine days, compared to a 2.1 reduction in the placebo group. The 50% responder rate was 68% for Solara versus 25% for placebo. A significant improvement in MIDAS scores was also observed. The safety profile was favorable, with the most common adverse events being mild nausea and fatigue, reported by less than 5% of participants in the experimental arm.\n",
