    "            placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the investigational drug \n",

    "            **Methodology:** Participants were randomized into two arms. The experimental arm (n=1,250) received a 100mg daily dose of Solara, \n",
    "            while the control arm (n=1,250) received a visually identical placebo. \n",
