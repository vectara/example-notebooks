      "\n",
      "4. **Mortgage-Backed Securities and Derivatives**: The crisis was exacerbated by the collapse in value of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and a complex web of derivatives linked to these MBS, which spread the financial contagion globally.\n",

      "5. **Liquidity Crisis**: As subprime mortgage holders began defaulting, lenders went bankrupt, leading to a liquidity crisis that affected global credit markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Interest Rate Changes**: The Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates from 2000 to 2003 encouraged risky lending, while subsequent rate increases from 2004 to 2006 raised mortgage costs and reduced housing demand.\n",

      "CRISPR gene editing is a powerful genetic engineering technique that allows for precise modifications to the genomes of living organisms. It is based on a simplified version of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas9 antiviral defense system. The process involves delivering the Cas9 nuclease, complexed with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA), into a cell. This complex can cut the cell's genome at a specific location, enabling the removal of existing genes or the addition of new ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CRISPR-Cas9 system works like genetic scissors, opening both strands of the targeted DNA sequence. This allows for modifications through two main methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Knock-in Mutations**: This method uses homology-directed repair (HDR) to introduce targeted DNA changes. HDR employs similar DNA sequences to repair the break by incorporating exogenous DNA as a repair template.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Knock-out Mutations**: These result from the repair of the double-stranded break via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or polymerase theta-mediated end-joining (TMEJ). These pathways can lead to random deletions or insertions, potentially disrupting or altering gene functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionized genome editing due to its precision, cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. It has applications in medicine, agriculture, and the creation of genetically modified organisms. It also holds potential for treating genetic diseases and conditions arising from somatic mutations, such as cancer. However, its use in human germline genetic modification is controversial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The development of CRISPR-Cas9 earned Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020. The technique was also recognized as the Breakthrough of the Year by the AAAS in 2015. In 2023, the first drug using CRISPR gene editing, Exagamglogene autotemcel (brand name \"Casgevy\"), was approved in the UK to treat sickle-cell disease.\n"
