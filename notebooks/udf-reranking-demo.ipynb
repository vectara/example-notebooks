    "# Introducing User Defined Function Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara has several out of the box rerankers, including [Maximal Marginal Revelance (MMR)](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/vectara-multi-lingual-reranker) and a [Multilingual Reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/mmr-reranker).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like more control over how the search results are reranked, the [User Defined Function (UDF)](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/user-defined-function-reranker) reranker is just for you! This reranker gives you the ability to use different operators and expressions to define how your retrieved search results are reranked based on document or part [metadata](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/document-data-structuring#metadata).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to combine multiple rerankers with our [chain reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/chain-reranker), allowing you to finely tune how retrieved results are ordered. If you are using multiple reranker, we recommend the reranking in this sequence: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multilingual\n",
    "2. MMR\n",
    "3. UDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The MMR and UDF rerankers both take as input the score from the previous stage in the chain reranking setting. However, the multilingual reranker is context-free and thus always reranks results independent of what reranker appears before it in the chain, thus if you use the multilingual reranker, it must be used as the first step in the chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate many of the capabilities of the UDF reranker using a corpus that contains reviews for Airbnb listings in Barcelona. We will compare the results of using the UDF reranker in the above reranking chain against the same query that uses the multilingual and MMR rerankers."

    "## Basic Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start off with a simple use case with UDF reranking. When looking for an Airbnb, you will probably be most interested in the highest rated Airbnb listings. To do this, we will add a function to our rerank chain that favors reviews on listings with higher ratings. This function will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`5 * get('$.score') + get('$.part_metadata.overall_rating')`\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost every UDF function, you will see `get('$.score')`. This function retrieves the current reranking score for each of the documents based on the previous retrieval and reranking step. At the the first step of reranking, this value depends on the embedding model, and will range between 0 to 1. After this, the range of the score will depend on the specific reranker in each step. One important thing to keep in mind when defining your user defined functions is that this score should always be non-negative, so make sure that any function you define always outputs non-negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number 5 in the above expression is somewhat arbitrary. This coefficient is simply scaling the weight between the importance of the previous reranking score and the overall rating of the Airbnb listing. You may have to play with these sorts of coefficients until you get the desired scaling for your application. When testing with different values, consider the possible range of values for each of the variables in your expression. In our expression, the `$.score` will range from 0 to 1 and the `$.part_metadata.overall_rating` (which is a metadata field) will range from 1 to 5 (because the star rating system on Airbnb ranges from 1 to 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now see how to include this function in an API request and compare the results against an example that does not use this expression:"

    "Another important consideration when choosing the right Airbnb is the location. Suppose that you want to find an Airbnb that is close to many of the top attractions in Barcelona so that your travel time is minimized on your trip.

    "## Temporal Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications, it may be important to sort the results based on temporal variables such as date or time. For our example, we would likely want to see the most recent reviews because those most accurately reflect the current state of the Airbnb. However, we do not want to completely ignore the relevancy of the review's content to our query. Thus, we will use the amount of time since the review was posted as a penalty to the original document score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since dates can go back a long time, we will ensure that the final document score is non-negative by taking the maximum of the udf calculation and 0. Our user defined function for this example is\n",
    "\n",
    "`max(10 * get('$.score') - hours(seconds(to_unix_timestamp(now()) - to_unix_timestamp(datetime_parse(get('$.part_metadata.review_date'), 'yyyy-MM-dd')))) / 24 / 365, 0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we converted all of our date strings to `datetime` objects (specifically, the `review_date`), specifying the format of the date strings.\n",
    "2. Next, we converted these dates to the number of seconds from the epoch using `to_unix_timestamp()`.\n",
    "3. We then used the `seconds()` function to indicate that the number we got from our previous operation is a duration in seconds.\n",
    "4. After this, we used the `hours()` function to convert the seconds duration object to the number of hours between these two dates.\n",
    "5. Then we calculated the number of years between these two dates by dividing by the number of hours in a day (24) and number of days in a year (365).\n",
    "6. Finally we specify the output of the UDF to be 10 times the previous score, minus the number of years. This means the penalty is proportional to the number of years since the review was submitted, with 10 years being the maximum (since we make sure it's not negative). "

My one gripe is Hugo made us feel very uncomfortable when he accused us of leaving the kitchen messy. The kitchen is shared and there were no bins to put bottles in which means bottles were left next to the bin. Another guest had used the kitchen and left it quite messy.

For example, suppose that you would like to give preference to Airbnbs with high overall ratings, but you will likely be more trusting of the rating if there are a large number of total reviews.

    "On the other hand, if you want to change your calculation based on some metadata, you can add this as a condition to your `user_function`.

      "Review: Great Airbnb with everything you could think of, very close to good food and a short walk to the beach. Hugo was lovely on arrival and even gave us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon. The Airbnb has a good kitchen and living area. Hugo and Loannis have a very unique style which we enjoyed. My one gripe is Hugo made us feel very uncomfortable when he accused us of leaving the kitchen messy. The kitchen is shared and there were no bins to put bottles in which means bottles were left next to the bin. Another guest had used the kitchen and left it quite messy. Either way it was very unprofessional and made our stay awkward from that point on. If it werent for this, this would be the perfect Airbnb.\n",

The kitchen had everything we needed (I have never ever been in an Airbnb flat with a kitchen that was that fully equipped). There were some communication issues at the beginning of our stay. I even got a call from (nor sure about that) the manager/boss from Kristjan and Ana. His communication behavior was completely inappropriate and therefore, not acceptable at all. However, we could sort out everything at the end (also with the help of Airbnb). The communication with Kristjan, Ana itself was friendly and professional. A big thank you to Maite who has showed us the flat, he stayed very calm and friendly during the heated discussions at the check-in, he was asking us during the stay if all good, he even offered us to stay an hour longer before check-out and last but not least, he went to the flat to log out of our Netflix account (what we forgot to do) after we have left the flat.

      "Review: Good afternoon all! Had a rest in Barcelona 26.11-04.12.2014. Appartamenta the excellent. Everything is very pure and accurate. Convenient kitchen. Certain dining room. In kitchen there is everything! Us there were 4 persons (2 couples). Separate bedrooms with a shower and a toilet. For two couples ideal option. Very convenient balcony with beautiful types. Special conversation for an arrangement of apartments. To the area of Spain of 2 minutes on foot, there the Arena, bars and all transport infrastructure. To Sagrada Familia went on foot, reached in 35 minutes (two times stopped to drink beer). Rambla - 15 minutes on foot or 5 euros for a taxi. The fountain 5 minutes are visible from a balcony, on foot. Modzhuik it is visible from a balcony... It is possible to tell about conveniences infinitely. Go better and look. Owners (Roza and Nicholas) helped with a parking. For it to them separate thanks. Met us very well and told about all possible routes in Barcelona. In total elaborately to trifles, even an umbrella and a bag for a supermarket. Supermarket round the corner. Very good impression about the apartment and owners. Gratitude to Roza and Nikolos. Everything was pleasant, will have to come back! Ivan, Lena, Olga and Alexey\n",
